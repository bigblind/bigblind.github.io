      <description>The 10th of October is World Mental Health Day. Mental health is still a huge taboo, even in the programming community, where we believe we&amp;rsquo;re so open-minded. Let&amp;rsquo;s change that.   </description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the advice to break your work up into manageable chunks, or to break a complex problem down into simpler parts. This is a handy technique to use while programming as well
You write a function to solve a particular problem, and you write it as if any complex functionality you wish for, has already been written. Afterwards,, you go fill in these functions, and apply the same technique.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of overhauling my personal website. In the process, I switched static site generators. I moved from Jekyll to Hugo. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I chose it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning and using Go for the past couple of months. Go is a great language, and Hugo is written in it. One of go&amp;rsquo;s strengths is cross-platform development. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to compile binaries for almost any platform out there. What that means, is that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to set up when using go programs like Hugo, just download the executable for your platform.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of content out there on how to make your website accessible. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen much on the subject of accessibility to users of screen magnifiers. I&amp;rsquo;m one of them, and I frequently run into annoying issues on the web.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll give some tips on how you can make your website more accessible to users of screen magnifying software.
Disclaimers:
 This article is purely based on years of using the web with a screen magnifier.</description>
