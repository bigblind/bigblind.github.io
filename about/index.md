Hi, I'm Frederik Creemers. I study Knowledge Engineering at Maastricht University in Maastricht, the Netherlands. I'm not completely sure what else to put here yet, other than that I love the web. I don't have a particularly successful project, or other "claim to fame." If you've reached this page because there's something you're wondering about me, feel free to <a href="mailto:frederikcreemers@gmail.com">contact me</a>. I might even add the answer to your question to this page
