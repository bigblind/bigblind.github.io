I'm never sure what to put in "bio" sections on websites, let alone the "About" page on my own site. If there's something you want to know about me, [just ask](https://twitter.com/_bigblind), and if it's a question I get often, or I just find it particularly interested, I'll add the answer here.

## Q&A

### How did you get into programming?

When I was bored in class, I used to make little mouse-maze games using Microsoft powerpoint. This got me interested in making games, and I discovered [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), whic has its own programming language built in called GML. While at a book convention in Belgium, I picked up "PHP and MySQL for Dummies", and that got me into web development.

### Why is your username "bigblind"? Are you a poker player?

My username on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_bigblind), [github](https://github.com/bigblind) and many other sites and platforms around the web, is <strong>bigblind</strong>. This username came about the first time I played poker. I played with my newhew and a couple of his friends, and the first time I was the [big blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_(poker)), we all laughed about it, because I'm visually impaired, and not in any dimension a small guy.

### In what way are you visually impaired?

I have dysplasia of the optic nerve. I'm not sure hot to express what I see and what I don't, because I don't know a percentage or measure to express it, and I've never had "normal" vision, so I have nothing to compare it to. I see almost nothing through my right eye, and quite a lot through my let eye (althoug I'm told compared to normal sight, it's still quite little).

I still see enough to visually find my way around places, although I do use a cane, bot to eel steps and other obstacles, and to signal my impairment to others. On a computer, I usually use a screen magnifier to enlarge whatever is on the screen. on my phone I use a combination of the magnifier ad VoiceOver (IOS's screen reader).
