I'm in the process of overhauling my personal website. In the process, I switched static site generators. I moved from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to Hugo. Here's why I chose it.

I've been learning and using [Go](https://golang.org) for the past couple of months. Go is a great language, and Hugo is written in it. One of go's strengths is cross-platform development. It's extremely easy to compile binaries for almost any platform out there. What that means, is that there's nothing to set up when using go programs like Hugo, just download the executable for your platform.

Because of this, I'm trying to limit the number of tools in my workflows that require specific environments. Jekyll was the only tool that I was using, that still required Ruby.

My jekyll installation had also gotten kind of messy, and it feels good to start over fresh.
